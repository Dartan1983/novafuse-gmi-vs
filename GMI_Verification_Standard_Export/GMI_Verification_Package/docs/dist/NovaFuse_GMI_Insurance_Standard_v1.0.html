## 1. Scope
Defines the minimum technical, operational, and verification controls required for an AI system to be classified as GMI-Compliant for underwriting.

## 2. Definitions
- GMI (Guaranteed Mathematical Invariance): enforcement of `âˆ‚Î¨ = 0` as a boundary law.
- FUP (Finite Universe Principle): systems operate within measurable, containerized bounds.
- Lyapunov Function `V`: measures deviation; descent enforced.
- Invariant Projection: componentwise projection onto `[0, GMI_ceiling]`.

## 3. Normative Controls (MUST)
- Boundary law: `âˆ‚Î¨ = 0` MUST be enforced for all admissible states.
- Lyapunov descent: `VÌ‡ &lt;= -margin` MUST hold at `t=0`; monotonic descent MUST be enforced via step controls.
- Control clamps: actuator outputs MUST be clamped to `Â±u_max`.
- Coupling &amp; damping: convergence MUST include coupling `K_couple` and damping `beta_damping`.
- Projection: projection onto invariant region MUST occur each step.
- Byzantine resilience: aggregator (trimmed mean or stronger) and quorum rule `2f+1` MUST be in effect.
- Timing hardening: monotonic clock and jitter buffer MUST maintain latency CV â‰¤ `max_timing_cv`.

## 4. Verification Harness (MUST)
- The adversarial suite MUST include at least:
  - Boundary containment; Flux defense; Convergence disruption; Lyapunov destabilization; Perturbation robustness; Byzantine fault tolerance; Timing attack resistance; FUP bypass.
- Pass criteria: all listed tests MUST pass concurrently; artifacts MUST be exported to JSON/CSV/HTML.
- Reproducibility: runs MUST be deterministic under fixed seed with recorded configuration.

## 5. Configuration Profile (Reference)
- lyapunov: `K_v=20.0`, `u_max=20.0`, `enforce_Vdot_ineq=true`, `Vdot_margin=1e-4`.
- integration: `alpha=1.5`, `beta_damping=0.20`, `K_couple=4.0`, `projection_on_step=true`, `line_search_max_tries=4`, `substeps=5`.
- robustness: `median_window=3`, `lpf_relative_cutoff=0.2`, `zscore_cap_sigma=3.0`.
- byzantine: `aggregator=trimmed_mean`, `trim_ratio=0.2`, `quorum_rule=2f+1`, `auth_enabled=true`.
- timing: `use_monotonic=true`, `jitter_buffer_ms=10`, `max_timing_cv=0.05`.

## 6. Audit &amp; Evidence
- Binder and Checklist MUST contain iteration logs, parameter fingerprints, and artifacts for last certified run.
- Evidence retention MUST include hashes and signatures for traceability.

## 7. Change Management
- Any material change to `config/tuning.json` MUST trigger re-certification.
- Versioning MUST update Certificate ID and RTS references.

## 8. Certification Criteria
- 8/8 adversarial tests passing.
- Documented monotonic Lyapunov traces and boundary invariance metrics.
- Timing CV within threshold; Byzantine quorum validated.
