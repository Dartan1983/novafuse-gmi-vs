# Market Entry Playbook — NovaFuse GMI AI Insurance Vertical

Date: 2025-11-22
Evidence: `adversarial_test_20251122-lyapfix-tune13` (8/8 pass)

## 1. Positioning
- Value proposition: Transform AI risk from existential to insurable via GMI.
- Proof: Deterministic invariants, Lyapunov descent, adversarial suite, machine-checkable proofs.

## 2. Regulatory Pathway
- Prepare binder and RTS; issue Certificate ID `GMI-CERT-2025-11-22-TUNE13`.
- Engage regulator technical review with artifacts and reproducible command lines.
- Establish re-cert cadence tied to change management.

## 3. Underwriting Program Design
- Products: Tech E&O, Product Liability, Catastrophic AI Liability, Cyber extensions.
- Eligibility: GMI-compliant only; profile integrity and evidence retention required.
- Limits/deductibles: class-based; reinsurance quota-share + per-occ excess.

## 4. Actuarial Pricing & Classes
- Use CES-based `R_C` control effectiveness.
- Class A/B/C stratification; set floors for `R_C` and timing CV.
- Pilots with initial rate relativities; continuous calibration.

## 5. Operational Controls
- CI/CD replays; artifact retention with hashes.
- Change management triggers re-rating and re-cert.
- Audit dashboards: Lyapunov traces, boundary metrics, timing CV, Byzantine quorum.

## 6. Go-to-Market Steps (90 Days)
- Weeks 1–2: Regulatory briefings; finalize RTS and Standard; issue draft certificates.
- Weeks 3–6: Underwriter training; broker education; pilot accounts onboarding.
- Weeks 7–10: Launch programs; publish case studies and artifacts; secure reinsurer panels.
- Weeks 11–13: Expand classes; iterate pricing; formalize certification marketplace.

## 7. Sales Assets
- Regulator-facing certificate; RTS; Insurance Standard v1.0; Actuarial Model deck.
- Evidence bundle: JSON/CSV/HTML artifacts; command lines; configuration fingerprints.

## 8. Risk Governance
- Quarterly actuarial review; semi-annual regulator updates.
- Incident response tied to invariants; claims workflows integrated with audit logs.

## 9. Key KPIs
- Certified deployments; pass-rate stability; timing CV; claim frequency; loss ratio.
