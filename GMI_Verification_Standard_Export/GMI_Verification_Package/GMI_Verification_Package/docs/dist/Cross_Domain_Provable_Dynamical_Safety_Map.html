Date: 2025-11-22
Evidence Basis: `adversarial_test_20251122-lyapfix-tune13` (8/8 pass)

## 1. Universal Method
- Container law: enforce `âˆ‚Î¨ = 0` via zero-flux boundaries and invariant projection.
- State `Î¨`: measurable state vector of the system; define `GMI_ceiling` and bounds.
- Lyapunov `V(Î¨)`: choose domain-appropriate deviation function; enforce descent.
- Control: gradient-based corrective action with clamps (`u_max`), coupling (`K_couple`), damping (`beta_damping`).
- Integration: substeps + backtracking line search to guarantee monotonic descent under perturbations.
- Evidence: adversarial suite tailored to domain; JSON/CSV/HTML artifacts; CI replay.

## 2. Domain Templates
- Template fields: `State Î¨`, `Container Bounds`, `Invariant`, `Lyapunov V`, `Control Actuators`, `Adversarial Scenarios`, `Pass Criteria`, `Regulators/Standards`, `Artifacts`.

## 3. Harness Adaptation Guide
- Map `Î¨` to measurable state; define `GMI_ceiling`.
- Choose `V`; set `K_v`, `u_max`, `K_couple`, `beta_damping`.
- Enable substeps and line search; projection each step.
- Tailor adversarial scenarios; set pass thresholds and timing CV.
- Export artifacts; log fingerprints and commands.

## 4. Certification &amp; Evidence
- Certificate ID tied to configuration fingerprint.
- Binder entries for artifacts and domain-specific tests.
- Recert triggers on any configuration change; re-run required.
