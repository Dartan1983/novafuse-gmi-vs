Date: 2025-11-22
Actuarial Basis: NovaFuse GMI Actuarial Risk Model

## 1. Evidence Requirements (All Domains)
- Certificate: `GMI-CERT-2025-11-22-TUNE13` (or current).
- RTS: `RTS-GMI-2025-11-22-TUNE13` (or current).
- Artifacts: JSON/CSV/HTML for last certified run; traces; scheduler stats; Byzantine maps.
- Profile fingerprint: `config/tuning.json` with hashes.
- CI replay: deterministic reproduction under fixed seed.

## 2. Underwriting Checklist (Universal)
- Controls:
  - `âˆ‚Î¨ = 0` enforcement; invariant projection each step.
  - Lyapunov descent with margin; substeps + line search; clamps.
  - Robustness: median, LPF, z-score caps.
  - Byzantine: `2f+1` quorum, trimmed mean, auth.
  - Timing: jitter buffer; CV â‰¤ 0.05.
- Evidence:
  - 8/8 adversarial pass; configuration fingerprint; artifacts retained â‰¥ 2 years.
- Governance:
  - Change management triggers re-rating and re-cert.

## 3. Domain-Specific Riders
### AI / AGI / ASI
- Exposure metrics: active users, deployed models, interaction volume.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.85`; timing CV â‰¤ 0.05.
- Limits: cat AI liability with per-occ excess; cyber extensions.

### Synthetic Biology
- Exposure: lab sites, organisms, genetic constructs.
- Riders: biosafety audits; genetic firewall validation.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.85`; containment breaches = 0.

### Financial Systemic Risk
- Exposure: institutions, counterparties, flows.
- Riders: stress harness for cascades; liquidity controls.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.80`; cascade beyond bounds = 0.

### Power Grid Stability
- Exposure: nodes, MW capacity.
- Riders: N-1 suite tied to GMI invariants; telemetry auth.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.85`; frequency/voltage within bounds.

### Nuclear Command &amp; Control
- Exposure: sites, command links.
- Riders: no-launch manifold certification; dual-control audits.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.90`; invariant breach probability â‰ˆ 0.

### Climate Intervention
- Exposure: controlled variables; geoengineering projects.
- Riders: tipping-point models; feedback bounds.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.80`; no runaway behavior.

### Swarm Robotics
- Exposure: fleet size; mission profiles.
- Riders: geofence enforcement; anti-spoofing.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.80`; containment violations = 0.

### Distributed Ledger
- Exposure: validators; transaction throughput.
- Riders: Byzantine maps; partition tests.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.80`; safety/liveness maintained.

### Quantum Error Correction
- Exposure: logical qubits; cycles.
- Riders: burst-error tests; timing jitter cycles.
- CES floors: `R_C â‰¥ 0.80`; logical error below threshold.

## 4. Pricing Guidance
- Use CES-based modifiers; apply class stratification (A/B/C) and reinsurance.
- Recert cadence: Class A quarterly; B semi-annual; C annual.

## 5. Claims &amp; Incident Response
- Incident classification: invariant breach vs. controlled event.
- Forensic artifacts: required logs and traces; CI replay for adjudication.
